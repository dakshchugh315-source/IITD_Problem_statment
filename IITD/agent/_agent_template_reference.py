"""
Minimal Battle Arena agent - a running starting point, deliberately naive.

    python agent_template.py

What it does, phase by phase:
    closed    waits for the arena to open
    recon     one search page per requisition, keeps a shortlist (offers are locked)
    market    buys a profile for each shortlisted candidate, signs anyone who looks
              good enough, never spending below the closing reserve
    closing   spends the reserve on a few more signings (offers cost double now)
    closed    prints the ledger and exits

It handles running out of credits, empty searches, rejected offers and the rate limit
(the client retries 429s for you). It does NOT do any of the things that score well:
see "IDEAS" at the bottom. Beating it should be easy.

# IDEAS - what this agent ignores, roughly in order of value:
#   * requisitions list the skills they want; normalise spellings (JS, k8s, Postgres ...) and match them
#   * read the whole pool's summaries during recon - a search page of 100 costs 1 credit
#   * batch profiles (50 for 60 credits) instead of 2 credits each
#   * the requisition bar has a salary budget too; the profile carries expected CTC
#   * a profile's assessment is unverified (and sometimes missing); /assess is the verified one
#   * fabricated profiles exist - which ones would you check before signing?
#   * recruiter notes carry signal
#   * the same person can appear twice under different ids
#   * sign at 11:30 sharp: the best names go first
#   * decide spend from PENALTY_FACTOR instead of fixed numbers
